ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m an Azure DevOps and Automation Engineer. I have lived in Shanghai, Edinburgh, Melbourne and now in Sydney.
 
ğŸ’™ Currently, I am passionate about cloud solutions and devote myself to Azure and AWS cloud services.

ğŸŒ± I'm currently learning Azure through doing hands-on labs with ACG and Azure DevOps labs.

ğŸ˜„ I travelled to over 15 countries to get a better understanding of different cultures.

ğŸŒ¿ When I am not working and learning, I am playing board games and training my kitty to sit, shake paw and lying down.
