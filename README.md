Hi ğŸ‘‹ 

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m an Azure DevOps and Automation Engineer. I have lived in Shanghai, Ediburgh, Melbourne and now in Sydney.

ğŸ’™ Currently, I am passionate about cloud solutions and devote myself to Azure and AWS cloud services.

ğŸŒ± I'm currently learning Azure through doing hands-on labs in my spare time with ACG and Azure DevOps labs.

ğŸ˜„ In the past, I travelled over 15 countries , to get a better understanding of different cultures.

ğŸŒ¿ When I am not working and learning, I am playing board games and training my kitty to sit, to shake paw and lying down.
